# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-QUINE-MCCLUSKEY-LOGIC-MINIMIZATION-ALGORITHM
The minimization of logic gates is needed to simplify the hardware design area of programmable logic
arrays (PLAs) and to speed up the circuits. The VLSI designers can use minimization methods to produce high
speed, inexpensive and energy-efficient integrated circuits with increased complexity. Quine-McCluskey (Q-M)
is an attractive algorithm for simplifying Boolean expressions because it can handle any number of variables. In
the following project, we present optimized Quine- McCluskey method that reduces the run time complexity of
the algorithm by proposing an efficient algorithm for determination of Prime Implicants.
